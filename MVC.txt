Programming Improvements

1.Unified way of building web as well as API(MVC or API controllers are same)
2.Integration of modern client framework and development workflows.example-- Bower
3.Acloud ready envoirnment
4.Built in depency injection.
5.New light weight and modular HTTP request pipeline.we can build our own pipeline
6.COre is collection of middlewares.i.e. we can plug and unplug from pipeline..suppose we have help API and we dont want identity or authentication for it.so we unplug auth API.
6.Kestrel 
7.entire on Nuget packaages



Middleware
Middleware is a software that is assembeled into an application pipeline to handle req and responses
RRequest delegates are used to build requestpipeline
app.run(),run allws to write code 
app.map(),
app.use(),already bilt use it

useStaticfile()---


MVC Design pattern


Model--state of the program like variable ,types
Controllers----Logic of the program,all req and res is processed by controller(In core 2.0 we can directly requuest the 		view and other resources independent of controller)
View---presentation,all i/o required,all html,js,css,etc



user requests the response to controller ,controller prepares the model and passes that model to view and then view renders this model.

controller is collection of action methods
Action Methods---a method written using IActionResult,ActionResult or its derived types
ActionHelpers or helper methods are provided for every ActionMethod type---First name are helpe methods
Helper methods are used  to convert and return according to type..


COntentResult --in this we can pass instructions also like "text/html","text/javascriopt"
